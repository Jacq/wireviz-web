A wrapper around the excellent WireViz_ by `Daniel Rojas`_ for bringing it to the web.
Originally conceived within a `WireViz fork`_ by `Jürgen Key`_.

Thanks!

Details
*******
WireViz is a tool for easily documenting cables, wiring harnesses and connector pinouts.
It takes plain text, YAML-formatted files as input and produces beautiful graphical output
(SVG, PNG, ...) thanks to GraphViz_.
It handles automatic BOM (Bill of Materials) creation and has a lot of extra features.

Look around, give it a test drive and submit patches.
